I first announced this mod at the start of this year, 2023, and it's now being released at the end of<br>the year. Is it some revolutionary mod the likes of 1864, 2025NL, etc.? No, it is not. This took forever because, quite simply, I lost<br>motivation several times throughout the development. Coupled with life getting in the way, I just kept putting off the mod over and <br>over again. I decided to release one part of this mod instead of a full release, since I know a couple of people were really looking<br>forward to playing something that has to do with South Dakota. The full release should be coming relatively soon, and if you're<br>reading this and it already has, whoops, I forgot to update the recommended reading. Either way, I hope you enjoyed the mod.<br><br>So, what's next? Well, I already have another statewide mod coming down the pipeline, the 1952 US Senate race in Arizona.<br>You'll be able to play as either Barry Goldwater or Ernest MacFarland.
